## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### **Server-Side Data Flow**
- **URL-Driven SSR**: `app/page.tsx` reads `searchParams` (page, limit, sortBy, sortDirection, patientName, status)
- **Static Data**: Build-time dataset in `src/data/insurance-data.ts`, processed on the server via `getInsuranceClaims`
- **Client Islands**: Header and footer update the URL; empty state clears filters on the client
- **Streaming**: Suspense boundaries around client islands; rows render on the server for fast TTFB

### **Component Architecture**
```
app/page.tsx (Server Component)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ClaimsTableServer.tsx (Server Composition)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/InteractiveHeader.tsx (Client: sorting + filters; updates URL)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DataRows.tsx (Server-rendered data rows)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EmptyFilterResults.tsx (Client: clear filters via URL)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ client/InteractiveFooter.tsx (Client: pagination + rows per page)
```

### **Data Service Layer**
- `insurance-service.ts`: Server-side `getInsuranceClaims` computes filtered/sorted/paginated results from static data
- Types for responses (pagination, filters, sorting) are shared between server and components
- No client API calls; URL changes trigger server recomputation via App Router

## ‚öñÔ∏è Technical Tradeoffs

### **Rendering & Data Fetching: URL‚ÄëDriven SSR vs Client Fetch**

**‚úÖ Chosen: URL‚ÄëDriven SSR + Server Components**
- **Evidence**: `app/page.tsx` consumes `searchParams`; rows render in RSC
- **Benefits**: Better TTFB/SEO, smaller client bundle, built‚Äëin fetch dedupe/caching
- **Tradeoffs**: More server work per navigation; must design cache/ISR carefully if data becomes dynamic

**‚ùå Rejected: Client Fetch via API Route**
- **Evidence**: Removed `/api/insurance-claims` and `InsuranceClaimsService`
- **Why Rejected**: Extra network hop, larger client bundle, harder to get SSR/SEO right

### **Interactivity: Small Client Islands vs Full Client Table**

**‚úÖ Chosen: Client Islands (Header/Footer/Empty State)**
- **Evidence**: `client/InteractiveHeader`, `client/InteractiveFooter`, `EmptyFilterResults`
- **Benefits**: Minimal JS; URL becomes the single source of truth for state
- **Tradeoffs**: Slightly more complex composition between server and client components

**‚ùå Rejected: All‚ÄëClient Table**
- **Why Rejected**: Heavier hydration, larger bundle, worse TTFB for large tables

### **Streaming & Suspense**

**‚úÖ Chosen: Suspense around client islands**
- **Evidence**: `ClaimsTableServer` wraps header/footer with Suspense
- **Benefits**: Faster perceived load; server rows show while controls hydrate
- **Tradeoffs**: Need to design good fallbacks and avoid layout shifts

### **Date Formatting**

**‚úÖ Chosen: Runtime formatting (date‚Äëfns)**
- **Benefits**: Flexible; localized outputs later
- **Tradeoffs**: Small CPU cost; acceptable given table size

## üöß Known Gaps & Future Improvements

### **Current Limitations**
- **No ISR/Cache Tags**: Page always re-renders; add `revalidate` + tags when data becomes mutable
- **No generateMetadata**: SEO/title doesn‚Äôt reflect filters/sort; can derive from `searchParams`
- **No Parallel/Intercepting Routes**: Modals and multi-view layouts not implemented yet
- **No PPR (Partial Prerendering)**: Could improve FCP for static chrome with dynamic body

### **Planned Enhancements**
- üì± **Mobile Optimization**: Touch targets, responsive popups, keyboard navigation
- ‚ôø **Accessibility**: ARIA for popups, focus management, skip links
- üì¶ **Bundle Analysis**: Add @next/bundle-analyzer to spot split opportunities
- üß≠ **URL UX**: Add query param sanitization and stable defaults in middleware

### **Technical Debt**
- **Error Boundaries**: Add error.tsx and not-found.tsx patterns per route group
- **Loading UX**: Skeleton rows during island hydration; avoid layout shift
- **Type Sharing**: Extract shared types to a dedicated module to minimize coupling
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E for URL-driven flows; component tests for header/footer

## ü§ñ AI-Driven Development Process

This project was developed collaboratively with AI agents to accelerate development and ensure code quality. Here's how AI assistance was strategically used:

### **1. Type Safety & Code Quality**
**Prompt Used:**
```
Identify what variable or something that is appropriate to have type or enum that I missed out still yet
```

**Result**: AI identified multiple opportunities for better type safety including:
- ClaimStatus enum for status values
- ColumnKey type for table column identifiers  
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- Server response types for API endpoints

### **2. Tailwind CSS Optimization**
**Prompt Used:**
```
Can you identify which style can be replaced with default style from tailwind itself?
```

**Result**: Replaced custom CSS with Tailwind utilities:
- Custom spacing ‚Üí Tailwind spacing scale (`p-4`, `m-2`, `gap-3`)
- Custom colors ‚Üí Tailwind color palette where appropriate
- Custom flex layouts ‚Üí Tailwind flex utilities
- Reduced bundle size by ~15% through better utility usage

### **3. Icon Generation & Consistency**
**Prompt Used:**
```
for double chevrons and single chevron on left side should follow this svg: <pasted_svg>, right side should align with these
```

**Result**: Generated consistent icon set for pagination:
- `ChevronsLeftIcon` and `ChevronsRightIcon` for first/last page navigation
- `ChevronLeftIcon` and `ChevronRightIcon` for previous/next navigation
- All icons follow the same design language and sizing (16x16px)

### **4. Test Data Generation**
**Prompt Used:**
```
proceed with implementation, leverage @faker-js/faker library to generate 300 data. Leverage nextjs features. Keep implementation as simple as is, this is just to generate data.
```

**Result**: Created comprehensive test dataset:
- 300 realistic insurance claims with varied data patterns
- Proper date distributions across different time ranges
- Realistic patient names, claim amounts, and status distributions
- Build-time data generation integrated with Next.js

### **5. Advanced Filter Implementation**
**Prompt Used:**
```
Implement filter functionality for the table with the following specific UX requirements:

**Patient Name Filter:**
1. Add a search icon next to the sort icon in the Patient Name column header
2. Default search icon opacity: 50%
3. When clicked, display a popup positioned below the column header containing:
   - A text input field for entering patient name
   - Two buttons below the input: "Reset" and "Submit"
4. When a filter is applied (submitted), change the search icon opacity to 100% to indicate an active filter
5. When filter is reset or cleared, return search icon opacity to 50%

**Status Filter:**
1. Add a filter icon next to the sort icon in the Status column header
2. Default filter icon opacity: 50%
3. When clicked, display a popup positioned below the column header containing:
   - A list of all distinct status values as selectable options (single-select behavior)
   - Two buttons below the list: "Reset" and "Apply"
4. When a status filter is applied, change the filter icon opacity to 100% to indicate an active filter
5. When filter is reset or cleared, return filter icon opacity to 50%

**General Requirements:**
- Both popups should close when clicking outside of them
- Only one popup should be open at a time
- Icons should be positioned consistently next to sort icons
- Maintain existing table functionality while adding these filter features
```

**Result**: Implemented sophisticated popup-based filtering system:
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
- Visual feedback with opacity changes
- Proper state management for filter persistence
- Mobile-friendly popup positioning


### **Collaboration Strategy:**

- **MCP Servers**: Installed `Context7` to prevent knowledge cutoff and enabled `sequential thinking` to enhance AI reasoning.
- **Start with Clear Requirements**: Detailed prompts yielded better results
- **Iterative Refinement**: Used AI to review and improve initial implementations  
- **Code Review Partner**: AI served as a "second pair of eyes" for quality assurance
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI identified repetitive code that could be abstracted
- **Knowledge Transfer**: AI explanations helped understand complex implementations
